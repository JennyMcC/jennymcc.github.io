	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am currently enrolled in a 12-week coding bootcamp.  I was previously in retail management where we had made the shift to using technology to execute everything we did.  Ultimately, I wanted to be challenged in a different way, so I decided to enroll in the bootcamp so I could try a different and more creative approach to working in the industry.</p>
